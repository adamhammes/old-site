title:  Apartment Costs
---

A friend recently asked me if I was actually saving money by moving to an apartment.
I immediately replied without thinking "Of course!", but when pressed for numbers I realized I had never taken the time to go through and figure out what the cost of living was for either on or off-campus.

I'll start with on-campus costs, as they are easier to determine.
Iowa State University [conveniently lists](http://housing.iastate.edu/rates) the cost of all their housing options.
Here are the 2016-2017 rates[^1]:

| Building                | Single | Double |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Buchanan Suites         | $6592  | $5732  |
| Eaton/Martin Suites     | $6960  | $6052  |
| Traditional Rooms       | $5758  | $4429  |
| Maple Traditional Rooms | $5067  | $5299  |

Since I'm not sharing a room with anyone, and only sharing three bathrooms with five others, the single-person suites are a closer match to my living conditions than the traditional rooms.
In terms of actual quality, the Buchanan Suites line up the best with my house.

[^1]: I did not list the MU options as they are incredibly expensive.
