## Ingredients

* 2 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1 cup smooth peanut butter
* 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
* Large pinch kosher salt


## Directions

Line two baking sheets with wax paper or parchment.

Bring the sugar, milk, butter and cocoa to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then let boil for 1 minute.
Remove from the heat.
Add the oats, peanut butter, vanilla and salt, and stir to combine.

Drop teaspoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, and let sit at room temperature until cooled and hardened, about 30 minutes.
Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

## Notes

Sifting the cocoa powder before adding will make it easier to make the sauce.
It is possible to use quick oats in place of rolled oats, but in my experience the cookies don't retain their shape as well.
