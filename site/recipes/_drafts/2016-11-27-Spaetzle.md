## Ingredients

* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1-1/2 cups (210g) flour
* 3/4 cup (178ml) water
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 bouillon cube

## Directions

1. Combine eggs, water, flour and salt, beating until smooth.
2. Add bouillon cube to 6 cups boiling water.
3. Put batter into the square basket of the Spaetzle Maker and place over a pot of boiling water or cooking coup.
4. Slide basket back and forth, letting tiny dumplings fall into boiling water.
When done, they will rise to the surface.
Use a large slotted spoon to dip them out into a large covered bowl.
6. Repeat the process until all of the dough is used up.
7. Lightly toss with butter, parsely, and salt to taste and serve in place of noodles, rice, or potatoes.

## Tips

Consistency of the batter/dough is the most important thing.
If batter seems too thick, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time to desired consistency.
