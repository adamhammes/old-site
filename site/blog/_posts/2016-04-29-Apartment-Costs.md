title:  Apartment Costs
---

A friend recently asked me if I was actually saving money by moving to an apartment.
I immediately replied without thinking "Of course!", but when pressed for numbers I realized I had never taken the time to go through and figure out what the cost of living was for either on or off-campus.

Here are some simplifying assumptions I'll make at the beginning.

1. I will not be cooking at my place; I'll instead purchase a meal plan.
2. I will not be subleasing my apartment for the summer, and will bite the bullet on the three month's rent.

I'll start with on-campus costs, as they are easier to determine.
Iowa State University [conveniently lists](http://housing.iastate.edu/rates) the cost of all their housing options.
Here are the 2016-2017 rates[^1]:

| Building                | Single | Double |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Buchanan Suites         | $6592  | $5732  |
| Eaton/Martin Suites     | $6960  | $6052  |
| Traditional Rooms       | $5758  | $4429  |
| Maple Traditional Rooms | $5067  | $5299  |

Since I'm not sharing a room with anyone, and only sharing three bathrooms with five others, the single-person suites are a closer match to my living conditions than the traditional rooms.
In terms of actual quality, the Buchanan Suites line up the best with my house (the Eaton/Martin suites are VERY luxurious), so we end up with a final price tag of $6592.
We'll ignore the required meal plan in order to keep the comparison as simple as possible.

On the other side of the equation are the off-campus costs.
I will pay an average of $320 a month, plus $100 in utilities.
Here we run into the first complicating factor.
My lease runs for 12 months - August 2016 until July 2017.
This length of time is standard for off-campus living - it's not unique to my living situation.

There does exist the possibility of subleasing my house for the summer should I not be in Ames, but that isn't a sure thing.
As this hassle does not exist with on-campus living, I'm going to include the three summer months into the off-campus cost.
Over the course of 12 months then, we end up with a final price tag of (320 + 100) * 12 = $5040.

There are additional one-time costs associated with moving out of the dorms, specifically furniture.
Here are the items I'll be buying that would be provided on-campus:

| Item       | Cost |
| ---------- | ---- |
| Mattress   | $350 |
| Bed Frame  | $50  |
| Box Frame  | $40  |
| Desk       | $100 |
| Chair      | $75  |
| Misc. [^2] | $50  |
| Total      | $615 |

Combining the one-time costs with the monthly expenses yields a figure of $5655 - still a thousand dollars cheaper than the $6592 we decided as the price of on-campus living.

So why the difference in price?
Assuming that on-campus is **not** just a university scam, there are the two primary advantages of on-campus living that aren't reflected in the price tag:

1. On-campus living is (obviously) much closer to campus.
Walking to class took 10 minutes last year; at my house it will require a bus ride.
2. I'm surrounded by other people my age.
This can definitely be seen as a drawback, but for my freshmen year it definitely helped me make friends.

It's up to you to decide if the above two factors are worth $1000.

On a final note, I will say that this comparison is incredibly unfair to off-campus living.
Removing the two simplifying assumptions I made at the start of this post would save around $2400 [^3].
Finally, the real reason I'm moving into a house isn't for financial reasons - it's so I can live my best college friends.

[^1]: I did not list the MU options as they are incredibly expensive.

[^2]: Toilet paper, cleaning supplies and the like.

[^3]: Three months rent - subleaser's fee would knock off $900.
Reducing my meal cost to $5 from $7.84 (the avg. meal cost with a gold plan) would save another $1500.
